# Release Steps

This is an internal to-do list with the necessary steps for creating new releases to this repository. 

## Before releasing

1) If new C-SDK, update linux version in `nodesdk/binding.gyp`
2) Check that nodesdk builds on Windows
3) Check that nodesdk builds on Mac
4) Check that nodesdk builds on Linux
5) If release contains new events, they must be added to `electronrendererhelper`

## Beta release

1) Update version number in `package.json`. Postfix with dash beta, eg. `3.1.0-beta.3`   
2) Update [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) with beta changes
3) Run `npm audit` to check for vulnerabilities, and fix if any
4) Publish to npm with beta tag: `npm publish --tag beta` 
5) Update apps depended on the nodesdk with the new release 
- electronhelper (and publish this package to npm if needed)
- testapp
- demoapp
6) Update Jira tasks and email stakeholders

## Prod release

Follow same steps as beta release but remove `-beta.x` from version name, and remove `--tag beta` when publishing to npm. Beta sections in changelog should be merged under the new production version number.
