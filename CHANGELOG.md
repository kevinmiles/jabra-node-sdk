All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file

### General

Latest version 3.1.0 is a production release for all supported platforms: Windows, Mac and Linux.

This release includes miscellaneous bugfixes, feature wrappers, update to the underlying C-library and general improvements that results in faster operation and much improved stability.

V3.1.0 production version is code-wise identical to v3.1.0-beta4. If you already have integrated the v3.1.0-beta4, you should not experience any need for changes.

--------------------------------

### v3.2.0-beta.1
- Added support for DectInfo events (DectDensity and DectErrorCount)
  - Updated electron-renderer-helper to support DectInfo events
- Upgraded embedded native "C" sdk to v1.8.7.12

### v3.1.0 (2020-06-16)
- Upgraded embedded native "C" sdk to v1.8.7.11
- Added various new APIs for above "C" sdk, incl. reboot, locking etc.
- Added support for detecting non-Jabra devices (new optional argument to createJabraApplication).
- Updated related electron helper JabraApiServerFactory.create method arguments (optional package but breaking change if used).
- Updated 3rd party dependencies to latest versions, incl. security fixes.
- It is no longer necessary/advised to set GN_HID protocol to get 
  all call control events! Call control applications that upgrade should remove
  explicit setting of the protocol.
- Added support for RemoteMmi
- Updated electron-renderer-helper to support RemoteMmi events
- Fixed character encoding bug where special characters in Windows username would cause wrong file paths
- Fixed links in readme.

### v3.0.0 - (2020-2-28)
- Upgraded embedded native "C" sdk to v1.8.3.10 which fixes the following:
  - Sometimes, core library functions could cause 100% CPU load on Windows clients.
  - Inserting or removing chorded headsets sometime could cause host application to crash
- Removed getLastFirmwareUpdateErrorInfoAsync (no longer supported by "C" sdk).
- Versioning scheme documented, beta disclaimer updated.

For other minor functional changes/updates, see release notes for v1.8.3 on developer.jabra.com

Disclaimer: Exceptionally, this release is only validated for Windows. Mac and Linux core library versions do not suffer from the 100% CPU utilisation issue. We therefore recommend that you for production use stay on v2.0.0 for those platforms, until the next general relase is made for all platforms.

Known issues: 
  - Third party products can't be recognized by NodeJS SDK. Non-jabra headsets are no longer visible through the API, as this option is turned off be default in new version of the underlying core library.
  - Speak 710 connected via Link 370 can't set settings (also present in v2.0.0).
  - API function enableEquailzerAsync() do not work as expected (also present in v2.0.0).

Device support:
The device support is identical to the one for Windows SDK v1.8.3.10, but please note that this release of the node.js SDK has only been validation-tested with the following devices:

- Biz 2400 II
- Engage 50
- Engage 75
- Evolve 65t
- Evolve 75 / Link 370
- Speak 710 / Link 370

### v2.0.0 - (2019-12-10)
- New npm package with gnaudio scope "@gnaudio/jabra-node-sdk" that replaces previous "jabra" and "jabra-dev" packages.
- New optional "@gnaudio/jabra-electron-renderer-helper" to make secure client-side access to Jabra api much easier from Electron.

- Complete rewrite in typescript based on N-API (Next generation APIs for Node.js)
  Provided API is ~95% identical but there are few breaking changes and bugfixes such as:
    - The default initializer function export (antipattern) is removed!
      The initializer function is now a plain function export called "createJabraApplication" that unlike the previous function 
      returns a promise which resolves when the sdk is initialized
      (See examples for new usage syntax).
    - Added scanForDevicesDoneAsync async on JabraType and removed similar sync function on DeviceType.
    - device deattach event takes a DeviceType as single argument.
    - getAttachedDevices now returns an array instead of a map.
    - Changed devlog event to return a described object instead of string.
    - Some settings functions renamed, also now uses DeviceSettings as type.
    - Various bugfixes in typescript declarations.
    - Removed all FFI related artifacts, incl. constants and error codes.

- Known important issues: 
    - This version will nondeterministicly produce 100% CPU load on some Windows machines in some 
      CC scenarios. We aim to identify and fix this issue in an upcomming beta release.
