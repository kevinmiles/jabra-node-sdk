# Jabra Node.js SDK

This is the monorepo for the new Jabra [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) SDK (a [native jabra SDK](https://developer.jabra.com/site/global/sdks/overview/index.gsp) wrapper) and related helpers, demos and tests.

This new Jabra Node.js SDK is based on [N-API](https://nodejs.org/api/n-api.html) and is thus Application Binary Interface (ABI) stable across versions of Node.js. It is also maintained as a core part of Node.js and known to work more easily with Electron (https://electronjs.org/) across versions.
